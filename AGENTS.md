## Shared TerraScale rules

### Shipping code

- No PRs, reviews or merge queue. Push to `main`. Ignore outside contributors' PRs unless asked.
- Fetch `origin` first. Branch from fresh `origin/main` in your own worktree or clone, outside shared checkouts. Commit small changes; no AI attribution.
- Before every push: `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main`, then pass the changed area's Fast tests on a dev host with `ts-heavy-any <cmd> --repo <repo> --branch <ref>`. Push `git push origin HEAD:main`; rebase and retry a non-fast-forward rejection. Never force-push or delete `main`.
- CI runs on every main push; deploy only green main. If your push makes main red, fix or revert within about 30 minutes. For a red main you did not cause, wait for its owner's fix and rebase.
- Heavy builds, tests, benchmarks and stress repeats use `ts-heavy-any`, never GitHub Actions. Use mariogk-dev or beta; never run anything on or SSH to mariogk-desktop.
- Prove flaky fixes with 5 repeats; benchmarks with 3 measured repeats in `benchmark/bench/`. For page changes, report before/after screenshots.
- StorageFormat.cs bumps and production resets belong to the lane in `.cos/lanes.md`; other lanes put `Needs format bump` in the commit message.

### Agents and decisions

- Use gpt-6.1-sol (Codex, high effort; low for work under 10 minutes) for most work. Use claude-haiku-5-5 for bounded work of at most 20 minutes; never Haiku 4.5 or the `haiku` alias. Reserve claude-opus-5-5 for engine/replication, auth/security design, billing correctness, production infrastructure or work Sol already failed.
- Decide and continue. Record `DECISION: <choice>. Reason: <why>` in commits.
- Workers never ask the user. Send the parent `NEED Q-<ID>: <question> | options: 1) <recommended> 2) ... | DECIDED: 1, continuing`. Only the COS asks the user.
- Block only for a user-only secret/login, new paid capacity, or deleting serving infrastructure or unrecoverable data. Start login device flows yourself, show URL/code, then finish after the user enters them.

### Secrets and hard gates

- Runtime secrets: OCI Vault in gru via instance principal. CI secrets: GitHub Actions. Dev secrets: `ts-dev-secret get <name> | <consumer>` or `ts-dev-secret env <name> -- <cmd>`.
- Never expose secret values in chat, arguments, history, logs, git or commits. Use stdin or a 0600 file. Credential installs are one-command handoffs the user runs.
- Ask first before new paid capacity, security permissions or credentials.
- ts-auth and ts-dashboard store data in TerraBase through ts-dotnet; keep the SDK current with TerraBase's API.
- Outside the monorepo, never download or run TerraBase binaries in tests, CI or helpers; use HTTP fakes or contract fixtures. Live ts-status API monitoring is allowed. Never publish TerraBase binaries.
- Use GitHub and `gh`; no polling loops. Never revive ts-reviewer or ts-cos.

# Working in ts-resources

This public repository collects resource snapshots. Repository issues belong in
GitHub Issues; TerraScale tickets belong in Ku (ku MCP, ku.mariogk.com).


## Layout and checks

- `sources/` holds adapted and original resources, `archive/` holds historical material, `logos/` holds logos, and `manifest.json` registers every file under those three directories.
- Fast tests: `python3 scripts/check_resources.py` checks hashes and image coverage; CI runs it for resource changes. No application builds are needed for documentation.

## Preserve the collection

Keep `archive/**` historical. Its README identifies dead references. Preserve
original dated evidence, review reports, changelogs, captured output,
`docs/evidence/**`, and `.qualification/**` under `sources/**` as well.
Update active instructions without presenting historical results as current.
Do not invent GitHub counterparts for retired repositories or issue numbers;
verify replacement repositories and paths with `gh api`.

For an adapted resource, update its SHA-256 and append a dated
`local_adaptation` note in `manifest.json`. Keep original source paths,
repositories, remotes, commits, and other provenance intact. Register new
resources under `sources/`, `archive/`, or `logos/` in the manifest.
